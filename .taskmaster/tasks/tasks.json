The pre-commit hook is set to run ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript type checks, and tests, while the commit-msg hook enforces conventional commit message formats. Additional scripts for type-check and prepare have been added to package.json.\n\nOn commit, only staged files are checked with ESLint and Prettier, type-checking and tests are run, and commit messages are validated for conventional format. Currently, there are 318 TypeScript errors and some ESLint compatibility issues with the latest Next.js/ESLint versions, which may block commits due to pre-commit hook failures. Further work is needed to resolve TypeScript errors, address ESLint compatibility, and plan a gradual code quality improvement strategy.
