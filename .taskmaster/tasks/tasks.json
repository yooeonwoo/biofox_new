Test Infrastructure Setup\n- Installed convex-test and @edge-runtime/vm dependencies\n- Updated Vitest configuration to support Convex function testing with edge-runtime\n- Configured environment-specific testing: edge-runtime for convex/ directory, jsdom for others\n\n#### 2. Test Execution Scripts\n- Implemented scripts/test-convex-functions.js for comprehensive Convex testing\n- Added dependency validation and multiple execution modes (coverage, watch, verbose)\n- Integrated NPM scripts: test:convex, test:convex:coverage, test:convex:watch\n\n#### 3. Comprehensive Test Suites\n- **Profile Functions (11 tests)**: Covered getAllProfiles, getProfileById, getProfilesByRole, getPendingProfiles, createProfile, updateProfile, deleteProfile, approveProfile\n- **Authentication Functions (13 tests)**: Covered ensureUserProfile, getProfileCompleteness, edge cases, and error handling\n\n#### 4. Test Coverage and Quality\n- Complete scenario coverage: normal cases, error cases, edge cases, business logic\n- Realistic scenario modeling with authenticated user simulation\n- All 24 tests passing with execution time under 1 second\n\n#### 5. Developer Experience\n- Detailed error messages and flexible execution options\n- CI/CD integration ready\n- Modular, extensible test structure with TypeScript support\n\n#### 6. Available Commands\n```bash\nnpm run test:convex           # Run all Convex tests\nnpm run test:convex:coverage  # Run with coverage\nnpm run test:convex:watch     # Run in watch mode\nnpm run test:convex:verbose   # Run with detailed logs\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a solid testing foundation that ensures reliability and prevents regressions during future code changes.\n</info added on 2025-07-23T06:28:54.523Z>",
