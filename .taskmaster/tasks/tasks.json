System Architecture\n\n### 1.1 Overview\n[Include system architecture diagram showing Convex, Supabase, and client interactions]\n\n### 1.2 Data Flow\n- Client -> Convex: Queries and mutations for application data\n- Client -> Supabase: Authentication and storage\n- Convex -> Supabase: Data synchronization (one-way)\n\n## 2. Migration Changes\n\n### 2.1 File Naming Convention\n- Changed files with hyphens to use underscores (e.g., `realtime-optimized.ts` -> `realtime_optimized.ts`)\n- Reason: Convex only allows alphanumeric characters, underscores, and periods in file names\n\n### 2.2 Type Safety Improvements\n- Added proper type handling for optional fields (e.g., `kolId`)\n- Implemented consistent error handling for null/undefined values\n\n### 2.3 Audit Logging\n- Standardized audit log creation with consistent recordId format\n- For bulk operations, using `bulk_[table]_[timestamp]` format\n\n## 3. API Reference\n\n### 3.1 Authentication\n- `auth:getCurrentUser`: Get the current authenticated user\n- `auth:getCurrentUserProfile`: Get the current user's profile\n- `auth:login`: Log in with email and password\n- `auth:logout`: Log out the current user\n\n### 3.2 Commissions\n- `commissions:listCommissions`: List commissions for a KOL\n- `commissions:calculateCommission`: Calculate commission for an order\n\n### 3.3 Notifications\n- `notifications:listNotifications`: List notifications for a user\n- `notifications:markAsRead`: Mark a notification as read\n\n## 4. Troubleshooting\n\n### 4.1 Common Errors\n- \"Could not find public function\": Ensure the function is properly exported and deployed\n- \"Type error in kolId\": Make sure to use proper type casting for optional IDs\n- \"RLS violation\": Check Supabase RLS policies and authentication\n\n### 4.2 Debugging Tools\n- Convex Dashboard: https://dashboard.convex.dev\n- Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com\n- Browser DevTools: Check for network errors and console logs\n\n## 5. Development Workflow\n\n### 5.1 Local Development\n```bash\n# Start Convex development server\nnpx convex dev\n\n# Start Next.js development server\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### 5.2 Deployment\n```bash\n# Deploy Convex functions\nnpx convex deploy\n\n# Deploy Next.js application\nnpm run build && npm run start\n```\n```\n\nUpdate system-limitations.md:\n\n```markdown\n# System Limitations\n\n## Convex Limitations\n\n### File Naming\n- Convex module files can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and periods\n- No hyphens or other special characters allowed\n\n### Type Safety\n- Optional fields must be properly handled with type assertions or null checks\n- Use `as` type assertions carefully and only when necessary\n\n## Supabase Limitations\n\n### RLS Policies\n- All tables must have appropriate RLS policies\n- Default deny all access, then explicitly grant permissions\n\n### Storage\n- Storage buckets must be properly configured with RLS policies\n- Large file uploads may require chunking\n\n## Integration Limitations\n\n### Data Synchronization\n- Supabase -> Convex synchronization is manual, not real-time\n- Consider implementing webhooks for real-time synchronization\n\n### Authentication\n- Supabase handles authentication, Convex uses the token\n- Token expiration must be handled properly\n```",
